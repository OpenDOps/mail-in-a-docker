# SPFIgnoreResults causes the filter to ignore any SPF results in the header

# Add OpenDKIM and OpenDMARC as milters to postfix, which is how OpenDKIM
# intercepts outgoing mail to perform the signing (by adding a mail header)
# and how they both intercept incoming mail to add Authentication-Results
# headers. The order possibly/probably matters: OpenDMARC relies on the
# OpenDKIM Authentication-Results header already being present.
#
# Be careful. If we add other milters later, this needs to be concatenated
# on the smtpd_milters line.
#
# The OpenDMARC milter is skipped in the SMTP submission listener by
# configuring smtpd_milters there to only list the OpenDKIM milter
# (see mail-postfix.sh).
